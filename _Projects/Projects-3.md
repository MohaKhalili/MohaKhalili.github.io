We prototyped embedded-based control systems along with an Android/IOS app to monitor ventilation, lighting, power and security systems. Apart from coding the microcontroller and prototyping an Android/IOS based App, I experienced about various aspects of running a startup, e.g., writing a business model and agile team managements. Raxia Tower Blocks and Niayesh Complex are two primary customers of our product. I learned how to handle all kind of customer issues with embedded microcontroller architectures and the required Ecosystem to make a successful product out of just a piece of silicon.
